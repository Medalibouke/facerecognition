# facerecognition


The facial recognition system is built through the Python language and the  computer vision library (Opencv).

1 - Face Detection : Determine the geometry space occupied by the face.
2 - Taking samples from the detected face ( more the number of samples is greater more the accuracy is height but at the same time it increase the calculation cost)
3 - Call the machine learning algorithm in order to extract the face characteristics of  each person.
4 - Face recognition : call  again the machine learning alogrithem in order to identify faces by comparison.
